# USB Midi Spinner

This is the code for the firmware for a USB Midi device I built, that reads a fidget spinner's position and sends it as a midi control input. I kinda hacked this together relatively quickly as I wanted to gift the device to a friend before they went home, so there are some fairly obvious code improvements that could be made, lol.
This project is based on the [Raspberry Pi Pico USB Midi Controller template](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/raspberry-pi-pico-usbmidi-platformio-template).
